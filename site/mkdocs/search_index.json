Docker Architecture\n\n\n\n\nDocker Containers vs Virtual Hypervisor Model\n\n\n\n\nIn the Docker container model, the Docker engine sits atop a single host operating system.

Images are used to create Docker containers.\n\n\nDocker provides a simple way to build new images or update existing images, or you can download Docker images that other people have already created.\n\n\nBuilt by you or other Docker users\n\n\nStored in the Docker Hub or your local Registry\n\n\nImages Tags\n\n\n\n\nImages are specified by repository:tag\n\n\nThe same image my have multiple tags\n\n\nThe default tag is \nlastest\n\n\nLook up the repository on Docker to see what tags are available\n\n\n\n\n2.2 Docker Containers\n\n\n\n\nDocker containers are the \nrun component\n of Docker.\n\n\n\n\nDocker containers are similar to a directory. A Docker container holds everything that is needed for an application to run. Each container is created from a Docker image. Docker containers can be run, started, stopped, moved, and deleted. Each container is an isolated and secure application platform.\n\n\n2.3 Registry and Repository\n\n\n\n\nDocker registries are the \ndistribution component\n of Docker.\n\n\n\n\nDocker registries\n\n\nDocker registries hold images. These are public or private stores from which you upload or download images. The public Docker registry is provided with the Docker Hub. It serves a huge collection of existing images for your use. These can be images you create yourself or you can use images that others have previously created.\nDocker Hub\n\n\nDocker Hub is the public registry that contains a large number of images available for your use.\n\n\n2.3 Docker Networking\n\n\n\n\nDocker use DNS instead \netc/hosts\n\n\n\n\n3.

Because Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API, any tool that already communicates with a Docker daemon can use Swarm to transparently scale to multiple hosts \n1\n\n\nArchitecture \n2\n\n\n\n\nSwarm Manager\n: Docker Swarm has a Master or Manager, that is a pre-defined Docker Host, and is a single point for all administration. Currently only a single instance of manager is allowed in the cluster. This is a SPOF for high availability architectures and additional managers will be allowed in a future version of Swarm with #598.\n\n\nSwarm Nodes\n: The containers are deployed on Nodes that are additional Docker Hosts. Each Swarm Node  must be accessible by the manager, each node must listen to the same network interface (TCP port). Each node runs a node agent that registers the referenced Docker daemon, monitors it, and updates the discovery backend with the node\u2019s status. The containers run on a node.\n\n\nScheduler Strategy\n: Different scheduler strategies (binpack, spread, and random) can be applied to pick the best node to run your container. The default strategy is spread which optimizes the node for least number of running containers. There are multiple kinds of filters, such as constraints and affinity.  This should allow for a decent scheduling algorithm.\n\n\nNode Discovery Service\n: By default, Swarm uses hosted discovery service, based on Docker Hub, using tokens to discover nodes that are part of a cluster. However etcd, consul, and zookeeper can be also be used for service discovery as well. This is particularly useful if there is no access to Internet, or you are running the setup in a closed network. A new discovery backend can be created as explained here. It would be useful to have the hosted Discovery Service inside the firewall and #660 will discuss this.\n\n\nStandard Docker API\n: Docker Swarm serves the standard Docker API and thus any tool that talks to a single Docker host will seamlessly scale to multiple hosts now.
